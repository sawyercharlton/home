I was born in Shanxi, China, in 1998. I received my B.S. degree and M.Eng. degree at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. I have explored and thought about many things in the world extensively over the years. Now, I am ambitious and determined to do something big.

I am focused on artificial intelligence and looking for a Ph.D. position in Canada 2025.
