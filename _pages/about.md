I was born in Shanxi, China, in 1998. I received my B.S. degree and M.Eng. degree at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. I've explored a lot over the years. Now, I am ambitious and determined to do something big. 

I am focused on Artificial Intelligence and looking for a Ph.D. program in Canada 2025.
